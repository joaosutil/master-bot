He has played on loan at Peterborough Sports and Redditch United.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nLomax made his first-team debut for Port Vale on 7 November 2023, in a 2–1 defeat at Wrexham in the EFL Trophy. He defended well on the right of the back three and showed composure on the ball when in position, with the manager Andy Crosby saying he \"performed to an incredible level for his debut\". Coach David Dunn claimed it was the best debut he had seen. Lomax made his league start on 29 December in a 3–0 win over Blackpool at Vale Park. He signed his first (two-and-a-half-year) professional contract in January 2024, earning praise from director of football David Flitcroft for his \"hard work and dedication\". Speaking in April, manager Darren Moore confirmed that Lomax had sustained an injury that would keep him out of action until the following season.\r\n\r\nLomax joined National League North club Peterborough Sports on loan in November 2024. Moore said he was doing \"tremendously well\" at the club after helping Peterborough to go unbeaten in four games. The loan was extended in January. On 27 March 2025, he joined Redditch United of the Southern League Premier Division Central on a month-long loan. Manager Matt Clarke said that the club was \"very fortunate to have him\" and that he was the best defender at Redditch.\r\n\r\nStyle of play\r\nLomax is a right-sided defender who can play as a centre-half, right-back or right-wing-back. A versatile player with good physical attributes and pace, he also possesses technical attacking skills.",
