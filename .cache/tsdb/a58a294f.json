On 8 February 2019, Sharp scored his 100th goal in all competitions for Sheffield United when he scored his second goal in a 3-3 draw against Aston Villa.\r\n\r\nThree days after the death of his newborn son in 2011, Sharp played and scored the opener in that game, and five days later he was applauded by the opposing Ipswich Town fans following his goal against them. He and his wife set up The Luey Jacob Sharp Foundation in aid of gastroschisis research and to support other people affected by this condition.",
