      "strDescriptionEN": "Andrew Kyere Yiadom (born 2 December 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as a right back or right midfielder for EFL League One club Reading. Born in England, he plays for the Ghana national team internationally.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nEarly career\r\nYiadom was born in Holloway, Greater London. He started his career in the youth team of Watford but wasn't offered a professional contract at the end of his scholarship. He signed for Conference Premier club Hayes & Yeading United in the summer of 2010. He only stayed for one season at Hayes before moving on to newly promoted Conference Premier club Braintree Town in August 2011, following a trial at League Two club Bristol Rovers. Yiadom scored seven goals by January 2012.\r\n\r\nBarnet\r\nHe was signed by League Two club Barnet on 31 January 2012. He made his debut for the Bees on 18 February 2012 in a 2–1 defeat to Shrewsbury Town, coming on as a substitute for Mark Hughes. He scored his first goal for the club on 10 March whilst coming on as a substitute in a 2–1 win against Port Vale.\r\n\r\nYiadom played an important role during Barnet's 2012–13 season. He was preferred as the right sided winger in Edgar Davids' 4–5–1 formation, with Ricky Holmes on the opposite wing. Yiadom became popular with fans for his pace, which he used to good effect on the wing, where he posed a threat to many opposition teams. Similar to Mark Byrne, Yiadom was used at times as a replacement right back following injuries and suspensions to first choice Barry Fuller. He started the last match at Underhill Stadium against Wycombe Wanderers, helping the Bees to a 1–0 win. His impressive performance earned him a spot in the Barnet line-up on the final match of the season against Northampton Town, though in his unnatural position of right back, with new signing Keanu Marsh-Brown being preferred to start on the right wing. Yiadom scored three goals in 31 appearances during the 2012–13 season.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Charlie William Henry Savage (born 2 May 2003) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL League One club Reading and the Wales national team. \r\nHe has represented Wales at various youth international levels and is the son of former Welsh international Robbie Savage.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nSavage was born in Leicester, Leicestershire, and was educated at Manchester Grammar School. He followed in the footsteps of his father, former Welsh international footballer Robbie Savage, by joining the youth ranks of Manchester United.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nSavage signed his first professional contract with Manchester United in April 2021. He made his first-team debut for United on 8 December 2021, replacing Juan Mata in the 89th minute of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League match against Young Boys, while his father, Robbie Savage, was co-commentating on the match for BT Sport. On 22 May 2022, Savage was named in a Premier League matchday squad for the first time, against Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nIn January 2023, Savage joined Forest Green Rovers for the remainder of the 2022–23 season.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nSavage has represented Wales at under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels. He was called up to the under-19 team for a friendly tournament in Croatia in September 2021, and scored in a 3–2 defeat to Austria. In September 2022, Savage was called up to the Wales under-21 squad for the first time.\r\n\r\nStyle of play\r\nA central midfielder like his father, Savage is comfortable both defending and going forward. Despite the similarities, Savage has said that he does not see the likeness, stating that he is more of a technical, ball playing midfielder, rather than a tenacious player like his father was.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Derrick Shaun Williams is a professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for EFL League One club Reading. \r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nWilliams was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1993, to an Irish mother and an American father. With his father serving in the United States Army at the time, Williams moved regularly during spells in Germany and the United States. In 2000, when Williams was seven years old, the family eventually settled in Waterford in Ireland. It was here where Williams began playing football, and was later spotted playing for Tramore AFC and Waterford. At 15, Manchester United offered him a contract, however he decided to join Aston Villa instead due to their success in developing academy players into first team players.\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nAston Villa\r\nAfter being spotted playing for local side AFC Tramore, Williams had trials for both Aston Villa and Manchester United, before signing for Villa in January 2009. Following a number of injuries to Alex McLeish's first team squad in the latter stages of the 2011–12 season, the versatile defender was brought in to train with the first team on a number of occasions. His first competitive involvement with the first team saw him earn a place on the bench for the defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea, and the draw with Liverpool.\r\n\r\nWilliams made his first-team debut under Paul Lambert, as a substitute in Villa's 1–1 Premier League draw against Queens Park Rangers on 1 December 2012. Williams played a part in the Aston Villa Under-19s' successful NextGen Series 2012–13 campaign.\r\n\r\nBristol City\r\nAfter struggling to make it into the Aston Villa first team, Williams signed for Bristol City, newly relegated to League One, on a three-year contract on 24 June 2013.\r\n\r\nWilliams made his debut in a 2–0 away win at Gillingham in the League Cup on 6 August, and continued to solidify his place in the line up, starting almost every league game for City that season. His first professional goal came on 15 February 2014, in a 2–2 draw at home to Tranmere Rovers.\r\n\r\nBristol City started the 2014–15 League One season with a 16-game unbeaten run, a club record, and the second longest unbeaten run in the country at the time, only behind Chelsea. Williams was a key fixture in this run, starting every game. His first goal of the season came in this run, in a 3–2 home win over Chesterfield on 11 October, and his second was scored in a Football League Trophy win over Coventry City in early December. Williams was sent off for the first time in his career in a 1–0 away defeat at the hands of Crewe Alexandra, forcing him to miss the following game. After returning from his one-match ban, Williams continued to feature on the left of City's three man defence, alongside Aden Flint and Luke Ayling. Williams played in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium on 22 March 2015, a game in which City beat Walsall 2–-0, becoming the only side to have won the competition three times. He was a regular in the City side that confirmed promotion to the Championship with three games of the season still to go.\r\n\r\nBlackburn Rovers\r\nOn 26 August 2016, Williams joined Championship club Blackburn Rovers on a three-year contract. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Cardiff City where he found the equaliser in the 90th minute of the match. In his first season with the club, he managed to make 39 appearances in the league and 3 in the FA Cup. He was also named as the Player of the Season.\r\n\r\nInternational career\r\nWilliams is eligible to play for Germany, the United States, and the Republic of Ireland. In February 2011, Williams made his debut for the Republic of Ireland U19 team against Croatia U19, before going onto play in three of Ireland's four fixtures of the UEFA Under-19 Championships later that year. On 10 September 2012, Williams made his debut for the Republic of Ireland U21 team, in a 4–2 victory over Italy U21.",
