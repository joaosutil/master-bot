Ultimately, he stayed on the south coast, signing a long term contract at Brighton. He made 36 Premier League appearances in the 2020–21 season, winning Brighton's 2020–21 player of the season award.\r\n\r\nWhite was named in the England team for the first time in May 2021, where he was selected as part of the provisional 33-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020. He was later cut from the squad, though remained on standby for the tournament and made his debut as a substitute in June in a 1–0 win over Austria. He made his first start for England in the second and final warm up match in another 1–0 victory, this time against Romania on 6 June. On 7 June, he was named in the squad as a replacement for Trent Alexander-Arnold.",

On 5 March, his change of allegiance was confirmed by FIFA. On 13 March, he was called up by England for their forthcoming UEFA Euro 2020 qualification matches against the Czech Republic and Montenegro. He made his debut on 22 March as a 63rd-minute substitute against the Czech Republic at Wembley Stadium.\r\n\r\nOn 25 March 2019, England manager Gareth Southgate handed Rice his first start for the national side during a 5–1 victory over Montenegro. Following Rice's successful season, he was handed a place in the England squad for the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals. In September 2019, Rice said that he had received online death threats after switching allegiance from Ireland to England. He was the first player to play for both countries since Jack Reynolds in the 1890s. Rice was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2020. Rice played in all of England’s seven games in Euro 2020 where they lost in the final to Italy.\r\n\r\nRice has been best friends with fellow England international Mason Mount since childhood.",
