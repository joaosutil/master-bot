He departed Carlisle in 2011 to join Barrow having failed to make an appearance in United's first team and in June 2012 he moved again joining Grimsby Town. After establishing himself as a first team regular at Grimsby he moved back west, for his 4th stint with Barrow. He would find his most prolific goal-scoring form yet in these two seasons, scoring 47 goals in 87 league appearances, which earned him a move to fellow National League side Tranmere Rovers. His time at Tranmere, when he scored 51 goals in 97 appearances, winning him the divisional Golden Boot award, ended in 2018 with a 2-1 victory in the National League play-off final. He left Tranmere at the end of his contract and joined Sky Bet League One outfit Walsall.",
